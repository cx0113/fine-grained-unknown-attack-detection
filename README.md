# fine-grained-unknown-attack-detection

(1) CICIDSSetting1, CICIDSSetting2, NSLKDDSetting1, NSLKDDSetting2:
These folders are the code of the proposed Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder and Extreme Value Theory Aided Two-stage Learning Approach.

(2)ClaAndAno:
This folder is the code of the baseline that use "Classification + anomaly detection". Random forest is used as the classification model. One-class SVM is used for anomaly detection.

(3)ResultData:
This folder is the code of the baseline EVM[2] and WSVM[1]. 
The code is obtained from "https://github.com/ljain2/libsvm-openset" and "https://github.com/EMRResearch/ExtremeValueMachine"


(3)adersarial:
This folder is the code of applying evasion attacks on the proposed method thorough fats gradient sign method[3].

(4)plot:
This folder is the code for plotting the figures
